# 👋 Hi there!

Welcome to my github!  
I am a **B.Tech Graduate in Computer Science and Engineering** from **Gauhati University, Assam, India**.  
I like to build stuff — could be anything, from the simplest and *"old"* methods to cutting-edge **GenAI**.
I love keeping myself busy thinking about new real world product ideas and how to implement them.  
Lately, I’ve been slowly adapting to *“Vibe Coding”* using different **LLMs**.
Please checkout my repositories to check my skills!
