# 👋 Hi there!

Welcome to my portfolio!  
I am a **B.Tech Graduate in Computer Science and Engineering** from **Gauhati University, Assam, India**.  
I like to build stuff — could be anything, from the simplest and *"old"* methods to cutting-edge **GenAI**.

I love keeping myself busy thinking about new product ideas and how to implement them.  
Lately, I’ve been slowly adapting to *“Vibe Coding”* using different **LLMs**.

## 🚀 Embracing the FUTURE!

Whether it's:
- Scraping data from the web  
- Converting handwritten records to structured Excel files using **GenAI**  
- Analyzing question difficulty with machine learning  

I thrive on solving real-world problems using the power of **code**.
